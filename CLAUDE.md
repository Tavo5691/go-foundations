# Go Foundations Learning Project

## Context
I'm a backend engineer learning Go. This is my practice repository.

## Learning Goals
- Master Go fundamentals (syntax, types, interfaces)
- Understand goroutines and channels deeply
- Build production-ready REST APIs
- Practice testing and debugging

## Code Review Expectations
When reviewing my code:
1. Explain WHY something is better, not just WHAT to change
2. Point me to official Go documentation
3. Show examples of idiomatic Go patterns
4. Help me understand race conditions and concurrency issues
5. Suggest resources for concepts I struggle with

## Project Structure
- `/cmd` - Main applications
- `/internal` - Private application code
- `/pkg` - Reusable packages
- `/tests` - Test files

## Current Focus
[Update this as you progress through the curriculum]
