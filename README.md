# go-foundations

Already did the Tour of Go, learned basic usage of slices, maps, structs, interfaces, methods.

Created basic tests and ran them with "go test", created modules and ran the main function with "go build" and executing the binary (Im using the Terminal and Ubuntu on Windows)

Still need to practice concurrency, but will move past the Tour of Go to learn with hands-on projects.

Will create the small programs next in this same repo.
